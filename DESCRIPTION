Description:
      The primary objective of the R Package is implementation of Probit Regression
      for Binary Responses via data augmentation and Gibbs sampling and its extention in modelling 
      Ordered Multinomial responses, as discussed in ”Bayesian Analysis of Binary and Polychotomous Response Data”
